# use-react-tabtrap

## React hook for adding Tab-trapping functionality.
    use-react-tabtrap will give a React Component Tab-trapping functionality by
    adding 'keydown' listener window. 
### Props 
```tsx
    {
        cleanUp: () => void // 
        ref: MutableObject<T extends HTMLElement | null>
        trigger: boolean //  a boolean value represents whether tabtrap needs
        focusable?: string // comma seperated string of querySelectorAll
        // usually you don't need to pass it, default value of focusable deals with the most case of focusable elements.
    }
```

        cleanUp,
    });
